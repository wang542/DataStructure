//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS;
//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
BFS (DFS will take long and solution is rare so the path may take long)
//If the tree is very wide:
DFS (BFS will require additional memory)
//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS;
//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
DFS;
//Finding the shortest path:
BFS;
